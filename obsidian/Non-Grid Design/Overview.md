### **Core Design Principles**

1. **Continuous Space Representation:**
    
    - Represent the battlefield as a continuous plane, with each agent's position described using a vector (e.g., `FVector2D` for Unreal).
    - Agents interact dynamically with their surroundings, eliminating snapping to grid cells.
2. **Dynamic Navigation:**
    
    - Use a **navigation mesh (NavMesh)** to calculate paths dynamically in continuous space.
    - Unreal’s NavMesh is perfect for this, even in 2D projects, and updates automatically for obstacles.
3. **Combat Interactions:**
    
    - Calculate distances between agents for melee or ranged attacks using vector math.
    - Use **line-of-sight checks** (raycasts) for ranged attacks and targeting decisions.
4. **Spatial Awareness:**
    
    - Leverage spatial queries to determine nearby allies, enemies, and obstacles:
        - Use Unreal’s collision channels or spatial partitions (e.g., quadtrees).
5. **Physics Integration:**
    
    - Add realism with physics-based interactions like knockbacks, collisions, or projectile trajectories.

### **2. Battlefield Design**

1. **Plane Setup:**
    
    - Define a continuous 2D plane where agents can move freely.
    - Add dynamic obstacles (e.g., walls, debris) to create tactical opportunities.
2. **Cover and Terrain:**
    
    - Mark specific areas (e.g., rocks, ruins) as cover spots.
    - Assign terrain costs to affect movement speeds or strategies (e.g., slower in water, faster on roads).
3. **NavMesh Configuration:**
    
    - Generate a NavMesh over the battlefield to handle navigation.
    - Adjust settings to account for agent sizes and dynamic objects.

### **3. Agent Design**

#### **3.1 Attributes:**

Each agent should have:

- **Position and Velocity:** For movement and updates.
- **Combat Stats:** Health, stamina, attack range, attack damage, etc.
- **AI State:** Idle, attacking, defending, retreating, etc.
- **Perception Radius:** Defines how far the agent can detect others.

#### **3.2 Movement:**

- **Pathfinding:** Use NavMesh for long-distance movement.
- **Steering Behaviors:** For close-range, fine-grained control (e.g., seek, flee, avoid obstacles).
    - Example: `velocity += (target - position).normalized() * speed`.

#### **3.3 Decision-Making:**

- **Behavior Tree:** Use Unreal’s built-in behavior trees to manage AI states and actions.
- **Perception:** Use Unreal’s AI Perception system to:
    - Detect nearby enemies (sight or sound).
    - Trigger state changes (e.g., switch to “attack” mode if an enemy enters range).

### **4. Combat System**

1. **Proximity-Based Combat:**
    
    - For melee:
        - Check if the target is within attack range using vector distance.
        - Example: `if (distance < attackRange) { attack(target); }`
    - For ranged:
        - Perform a raycast to verify line-of-sight before shooting.
2. **Cooldowns and Stamina:**
    
    - Add cooldown timers to limit attack frequency.
    - Use stamina to govern actions (e.g., sprinting, blocking).
3. **Target Prioritization:**
    
    - Agents can prioritize targets based on proximity, health, or threat level.
    - Example: "Attack the closest enemy or the one with the lowest health."

### **5. Machine Learning Integration**

To make decisions and learn strategies, incorporate a **Reinforcement Learning (RL)** model:

1. **Observation Space:**
    
    - Agent's position and velocity.
    - Positions of nearby allies, enemies, and obstacles.
    - Health, stamina, and cooldown states.
2. **Action Space:**
    
    - Continuous actions like:
        - Direction to move (e.g., 2D vector or angle).
        - Whether to attack, block, or retreat.
3. **Model Training:**
    
    - Use **Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)** or **Soft Actor-Critic (SAC)** for learning in continuous space.
    - Train agents to maximize rewards like:
        - Damage dealt to enemies.
        - Staying alive.
        - Completing objectives (e.g., holding a position).
4. **Fine-Tuning:**
    
    - Once trained, allow fine-tuning in real-time matches against human-controlled units.

### **6. Efficient Implementation in Unreal**

1. **NavMesh Setup:**
    
    - Enable 2D NavMesh support in Unreal.
    - Mark obstacles and cover dynamically so agents adjust their paths.
2. **AI Perception:**
    
    - Use sight for detecting enemies and hearing for reacting to noises (e.g., nearby fights).
3. **Blueprints or C++:**
    
    - Use Unreal's Blueprints for prototyping AI behaviors and logic.
    - Transition to C++ for performance-critical tasks like pathfinding or combat calculations.
4. **Animation and Physics:**
    
    - Implement smooth animations for actions (e.g., attacking, dodging).
    - Add physics-based reactions (e.g., ragdoll on death).

### **7. Example Workflow**

1. Place agents on a battlefield with NavMesh and cover areas.
2. Each agent:
    - Uses Perception to detect enemies.
    - Runs behavior trees to decide actions (move, attack, retreat).
    - Updates position dynamically using NavMesh for long paths and steering for local adjustments.
3. During combat:
    - Check distances for melee attacks or line-of-sight for ranged attacks.
    - Apply damage based on combat stats and adjust agent states accordingly.

### **8. Visualization and Debugging**

1. Add visual debug overlays for:
    
    - Agent perception radii.
    - Paths and destinations.
    - Attack ranges and cooldowns.
2. Record simulation runs to observe emergent behaviors and optimize strategies.
