### **Objective**

Develop a standalone medieval warfare simulation where AI uses reinforcement learning (RL) to learn and evolve strategies by playing against itself and human-controlled forces.

---

### **Phases and Milestones**

#### **Phase 1: Concept Design and Architecture**

1. **Define Simulation Rules**:
    
    - **Core Mechanics**: Unit types (infantry, archers, cavalry), health, damage, speed, and morale.
    - **Battlefield Design**: Flat terrain with obstacles like trees, rivers, and hills.
    - **Combat Logic**: Simple mechanics (attack, defend, move, flank).
    - **Victory Conditions**: E.g., eliminate all enemy units, capture a zone.
2. **System Architecture**:
    
    - **Components**:
        - Simulation Engine
        - RL Agent Framework
        - Human Player Interface
    - **Data Flow**: Real-time interaction between the simulation engine and AI learning module.
3. **Tech Stack Selection**:
    
    - **Language**: Python for RL and prototyping; C++ or Unity for the simulation engine.
    - **RL Framework**: PyTorch + Stable-Baselines3 or Unity ML-Agents.
    - **Simulation Framework**: Unity or custom-built.

#### Deliverables:

- Technical design document detailing mechanics, architecture, and tech stack.

#### **Phase 2: Build the Core Simulation**

1. **Basic Battlefield Implementation**:
    
    - Render a grid-based battlefield with moveable units.
    - Implement terrain effects (e.g., slowed movement in forests, increased visibility on hills).
2. **Unit Behavior and Mechanics**:
    
    - **Unit Types**: Infantry, archers, cavalry with basic stats.
    - **Combat Mechanics**:
        - Simple attack and defend logic.
        - Range mechanics for archers.
        - Charge bonuses for cavalry.
    - **Morale System**: Units lose effectiveness when surrounded or outnumbered.
3. **Simulation Features**:
    
    - Turn-based or real-time battle options.
    - Logging system to record actions, outcomes, and metrics for AI training.

#### Deliverables:

- Working simulation with units and basic combat logic.
- Visualization of the battlefield with minimalistic UI.

#### **Phase 3: Reinforcement Learning Integration**

1. **Self-Play AI**:
    
    - Implement reinforcement learning using PPO or DQN.
    - Define reward structure (e.g., damage dealt, units survived, objectives captured).
    - Train AI through multiple simulations, saving checkpoints for analysis.
2. **AI Action Space and Observations**:
    
    - **Action Space**: Move, attack, defend, retreat, flank.
    - **Observation Space**: Unit positions, health, terrain, enemy forces.
3. **Training Pipeline**:
    
    - Automate the training process with self-play matches.
    - Visualize progress using metrics like win rate, strategy diversity.

#### Deliverables:

- Functional self-play AI capable of basic strategies.
- Training logs and visualizations.

#### **Phase 4: Human-AI Interaction**

1. **Human Player Interface**:
    
    - Develop a control system for human players (drag-and-drop commands or RTS-style controls).
    - Display unit stats, battlefield conditions, and available actions.
2. **AI Adaptation to Human Opponents**:
    
    - Train AI with diverse strategies introduced by human players.
    - Analyze weaknesses and optimize AI to counter human tactics.

#### Deliverables:

- Human control system integrated with the simulation.
- Demonstration of AI learning from human interactions.

---

#### **Phase 5: Advanced Strategy Evolution**

1. **Memory and Adaptation**:
    
    - Implement long-term memory for AI to store effective strategies.
    - Use meta-learning to adapt to novel scenarios.
2. **Dynamic Learning System**:
    
    - Allow the AI to evolve strategies in real time during a match.
    - Introduce more complex mechanics like supply chains, weather effects.

#### Deliverables:

- AI capable of evolving strategies dynamically.
- Simulations demonstrating strategic depth.
