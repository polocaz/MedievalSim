The goal is to build a simulation that allows for agents to move along a grid environment and perform different actions. 

### **Environment

1. **Grid Representation**:
    - Represent the battlefield as a 2D grid where each cell holds information about the environment.
    - Store the grid in a **flat array** or **chunked array** for efficient memory access and caching.
2. **Cell Data Structure**: Each cell contains attributes relevant to gameplay and AI decision-making:
    - **Variables**
      - **Elevation**: Numerical value representing height above a base level (e.g., 0 = flat, 10 = high ground).
      - **Terrain Type**: Encoded as integers or enums (e.g., 0 = grass, 1 = forest, 2 = water).
      - **Movement Cost**: Precomputed value for how terrain affects movement speed.
      - **Visibility Modifier**: Determines how well units can see other cells and how well other cells can see units in the cell.
      - **Occupancy**: Tracks which unit or obstacle occupies the cell (if any).
    
    - **SoA (Structure of Arrays)**: Instead of grouping all attributes into one structure (e.g., `Cell`), split data into parallel arrays:

        ```cpp
        float[] elevation; 
        float[] movementCost; 
        float[] visibilityModifier; 
        int[] occupancyID;
        int[] terrainType; 
        ```

    - Benefits:
        - Better memory locality and caching.
        - Allows processing specific attributes (e.g., elevation) without touching unrelated data.
3. **Elevation Handling**:
    - Store **elevation values** as floats or integers in each grid cell.
    - Calculate terrain effects dynamically:
        - Movement: Units take longer to climb steep slopes.
        - Visibility: Units on higher ground can see farther and gain combat advantages.
        - Example: Use **line-of-sight algorithms** (e.g., Bresenhamâ€™s Line Algorithm) adjusted for elevation to determine visibility between units.
4. **Terrain Features**:
    - Encode terrain properties in a lookup table:
        `struct TerrainType {     float baseMovementCost;     float visibilityModifier;     bool isImpassable; // E.g., water for infantry };`
        
    - Terrain has different properties and the different types are stored in a table for quick lookups rather than storing the following for each cell

| Terrain Type | Movement Cost | Visibility Modifier | Impassable |
| ------------ | ------------- | ------------------- | ---------- |
| Grass        | 1.0           | 1.0                 | No         |
| Forest       | 1.5           | 0.5                 | No         |
| Water        | -             | -                   | Yes        |
| Hill         | 2.0 (steep)   | 1.2                 | No         |

### **Data-Oriented Design Principles for the Environment**

1. **SoA (Structure of Arrays)**: Instead of grouping all attributes into one structure (e.g., `Cell`), split data into parallel arrays:
```
float[] elevation; int[] terrainType; float[] movementCost; float[] visibilityModifier; int[] occupancyID;
```
    
    - Benefits:
        - Better memory locality and caching.
        - Allows processing specific attributes (e.g., elevation) without touching unrelated data.
2. **Chunking**: Divide the grid into smaller chunks or regions to improve cache performance and simplify large-scale updates:
    
    - Each chunk represents a section of the grid (e.g., 32x32 cells).
    - Process chunks independently during AI updates or rendering.
3. **Precomputed Data**:
    
    - Precompute costly values (e.g., movement cost, visibility) during initialization or when terrain changes.
    - Use lookup tables or arrays for fast access during the simulation loop.

### **Handling Interactions with AI and Units**

1. **Pathfinding**:
    
    - Use algorithms like __A_ or Dijkstra's_*, modified for movement costs and elevation.
    - Elevation impacts pathfinding costs dynamically (e.g., uphill = higher cost, downhill = lower cost).
2. **Visibility**:
    
    - Implement a **line-of-sight system** to determine what each unit can see based on elevation and terrain.
    - Example: Higher elevation increases visibility range; forests block line of sight.
3. **Combat Modifiers**:
    
    - Include **elevation-based bonuses** for attack and defense:
        - Units on higher ground deal more damage or resist attacks better.
    - Use visibility to enable ambush tactics (e.g., units hidden in forests remain unseen until in range).

### **Scalability and Optimization**

1. **Batch Processing**:
    
    - Update terrain effects, visibility, and combat modifiers in batches for all units within a chunk.
    - Minimize redundant calculations (e.g., precompute terrain effects).
2. **Sparse Representation for Large Maps**:
    
    - For very large maps with unused areas, use a **sparse grid** to store only relevant cells.
3. **Parallelization**:
    
    - Use multithreading or SIMD instructions to update multiple grid cells or units simultaneously.
